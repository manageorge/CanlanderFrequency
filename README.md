# CanlanderFrequency
Code which creates the data behind the [Canlander Frequency Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N7eovRSHXEDB3-8w_4lrgVKkWkvxES9jvScAVH0yzvs/edit?usp=sharing). The sheets are now updated irregularly. If I revist, I'll probably be starting from the ground up with a cloudflare worker of some sort. This code is not *good* but it is (largely) functional.
